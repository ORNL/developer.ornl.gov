We've launched this ORNL developer blog with the aim of
pointing to tutorials, walkthroughs, training,
and other technical documentation that gets cutting-edge
software to work for you.

Open-source blogs have largely replaced books
as the go-to source for up-to date, relevant,
and useful information for software developers.
That's because scientific communication has bifurcated
into academic literature on the one side, and, on the other,
tutorials, walkthroughs, technical documentation,
and training materials.

The first form is intended for other experts in the subject,
and tends to be short, precise, and formal, but also
dense, formidable and jargon-heavy.
The second is intended for new students, casually interested
generalists, and experts who need to get things done.

This divide is especially visible in the world of open source
software.  Traditionally, software development has been considered
technical implementation work - so not worthy of much description
in academic papers.  On the other hand, technical how-to information
is at the core of open-source.

If you'd like to contribute, follow the instructions
on [github](https://github.com/ORNL/developer.ornl.gov).
Note that our focus is on software that achieves DOE
mission objective to ensure Americaâ€™s security and prosperity
by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges
through transformative science and technology solutions.
