Compiling and running compute-intensive applications
on supercomputers is hard.  It's not well-known, but
ORNL has a user-managed software program that helps developers
share HPC codes they have compiled and tested with other
system users.

DFT-FE provides a real-space, finite-element implementation
of Kohn-Sham density functional theory that scales up
to the order of 100,000 electrons on thousands of Frontier nodes.
Computing the ground-state energy of a 4,800 atom quasicrystal
helped DFT-FE win the ACM Gordon Bell prize in 2023.

However, it also has some powerful library dependencies like ELPA,
pytorch, RCCL, and Deal.II, that can be tricky to compile
and use correctly.  ELPA uses advanced Fortran and ROCM+RocBLAS
features, while Deal.II uses advanced C++ features, and pytorch
is, well, pytorch.

We do have a 9-step installation process you can follow yourself
[here](https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/install_DFTFE).
However, following it can take a few days of
looking up system software locations, optimization flags,
digging through compiler error messages, finding workarounds
for bitrot (and emailing developers to let them know what's
deprecated, warnings turned into errors, etc.).
So we shared our installation by using user
managed software.  The process is explained below.

## Accounts

Apply for a user managed software account on OLCF using
the application form at [my.olcf.ornl.gov](https://my.olcf.ornl.gov).
After filling out the project agreement form, we received
account ums031.  It has access to

    /sw/frontier/ums/modulefiles/ums031 -- storage for ums031/* lmod files
    /sw/frontier/ums/ums031 -- storage for project files

## Installation

First, we documented the set of modules used for building
inside `/sw/frontier/ums/modulefiles/ums031/default.lua`,
then setup a python virtual environment in `$INST`,
where `INST=/sw/frontier/ums/ums031/gcc-mixed-12.2.0`.

Using a subdirectory like this allows me to try building
DFT-FE using alternate compiler toolchains in the future.
Note that gcc-mixed is slightly misleading here, since
the CC,cc,and ftn compilers are actually AMD clang and flang.
Adding gcc-mixed just prevents using the system gcc (version 7)
in favor of gcc-12.

    load("PrgEnv-amd")
    load("amd/5.7.0")
    load("gcc-mixed/12.2.0")
    load("cray-mpich/8.1.27")
    prepend_path("LD_LIBRARY_PATH", "/opt/cray/pe/mpich/8.1.27/gtl/lib")
    load("craype-accel-amd-gfx90a")
    load("openblas/0.3.17")
    load("cray-python/3.11.5")
    unload("cray-libsci")
    load("netlib-scalapack/2.2.0")
    prepend_path("PATH", "/sw/frontier/ums/ums031/gcc-mixed-12.2.0/bin")
    setenv("VIRTUAL_ENV", "/sw/frontier/ums/ums031/gcc-mixed-12.2.0")

Note that it's important to use `module show cray-mpich/8.1.27`
and read through the [OLCF User Docs](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/frontier_user_guide.html) to make sure your choices of modules are compatible.

With the modules setup, we ran `module load ums; module load ums031`,
then built all the software.
For each, we set `--prefix` (autotools)
or `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` (cmake) to `$INST`.


## Linking

Running `ldd` to look at the shared library dependencies
of the real/lib/libdftfe.so library, we noticed
several were missing.  This can be the case when the
shared objects are not compiled with `-Wl,-rpath=$INST/lib`
so that they can find other libraries in the same directory
`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`.  Worse, `/opt/rocm-5.7.0/lib` was in the RPATH,
which meant it could be overridden if someone set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
somewhere else (for example loading the wrong set of modules).

So, we downloaded and compiled [patchelf](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf)
(using gcc).

    readelf -d libdftfe.so | head -20
    patchelf --remove-rpath libdftfe.so
    patchelf --set-rpath /opt/rocm-5.7.0/lib:$INST/lib:$INST/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/lib --force-rpath libdftfe.so

Fixes the issue for the library, which you can see by running `ldd libdftfe.so` again.
Next up, we fixed the rpaths on the `real/bin/dftfe` and `cplx/bin/dftfe`
executables.

    cd $INST/real/bin
    patchelf --set-rpath /sw/frontier/spack-envs/base/opt/cray-sles15-zen3/cce-15.0.0/darshan-runtime-3.4.0-t6el25xrwgfg5j65rdrhrs3qjp4ojssp/lib:/opt/rocm-5.7.0/lib:$INST/real/lib:$INST/lib:$INST/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/lib --force-rpath dftfe
    cd $INST/cplx/bin
    patchelf --set-rpath /sw/frontier/spack-envs/base/opt/cray-sles15-zen3/cce-15.0.0/darshan-runtime-3.4.0-t6el25xrwgfg5j65rdrhrs3qjp4ojssp/lib:/opt/rocm-5.7.0/lib:$INST/cplx/lib:$INST/lib:$INST/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/lib --force-rpath dftfe

Finally, some linking provides some nicely named top-level programs:

    cd $INST/bin
    ln -s ../real/bin/dftfe dftfe.real
    ln -s ../cplx/bin/dftfe dftfe.cplx

## Testing

It's important to test newly compiled software before your
collaborators start reporting strange bugs that are really
issues coming from hardware incompatibility / linking / finding paths / etc.

We first checked the tests included with DFT-FE
(dftfe/testsGPU).  Next we went on to a more
challenging example -- a transition path calculation
using the NEB method
written by Kartick,
in the
[DFT-FE benchmark](https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe-benchmarks) set.

```
git clone https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe-benchmarks
cd dftfe-benchmarks/accuracyBenchmarks/NEB/Li2O/dftfe
ln -s ../*.upf ./
cat >>Input_NEB.prm <<EOF
subsection GPU
  set USE GPU=true
  set USE ELPA GPU KERNEL=true
end
EOF
cat >job.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -A stf006
#SBATCH -J Li2O
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00
#SBATCH -p batch
#SBATCH -N 100
#SBATCH --gpus-per-node 8
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-gpu 1
#SBATCH --gpu-bind closest

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
n=$((SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES*8))
srun -n $n -c 7 --gpu-bind closest \
          dftfe.real Input_NEB.prm
EOF 
sbatch job.sh
```

Note that this example adds a "GPU" subsection to
the parameter file.  That section is necessary in
order to make use of the GPUs on Frontier - so
be sure to include it in your own projects!

The neb results can be checked against the
reference provided by the example
in the `output` directory.


## More information

In addition to the examples from the [benchmarks repository](https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe-benchmarks),
the DFT-FE user manual is important for setting up the
input parameter file.  It can be found on the
